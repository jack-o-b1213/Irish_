- Scrape daft.ie
- convert to csv
- remove any rows without an actual price (descriptions or other nonsense)
- any entries with "prices from: x" etc. were just set to whatever the x was
- Any prices in Pound, euro value used
- Separate out by county
- Any address with the county twice had one of them removed (Redundant and interferes with excel formula)
- Remove duplicate listings
- once excel cleansing has been done the dataset is saved as housingPrices_cleansed.csv
